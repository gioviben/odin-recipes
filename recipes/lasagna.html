        </li>
        <li>Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg, then remove from heat.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <li>Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of béchamel and a generous amount of mozzarella on top.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Lasagna</h3>

        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
