        <li>A sprinkle of coarse salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil (or lard) and water gradually, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, then cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced pancetta (if using) and cook until crispy.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the Swiss chard (or spinach) and cook until wilted and most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan, seasoning with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Erbazzone</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two parts: one slightly larger for the base and one smaller for the top.</li>
        <li>Roll out the larger portion into a thin sheet and place it in a greased baking pan.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second piece of dough and place it over the filling, sealing the edges.</li>
        <li>Prick the top with a fork to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Brush with olive oil or melted lard and sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Erbazzone</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Let it cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Erbazzone is best enjoyed warm or at room temperature, served with a side of cured meats like Prosciutto di Parma or a fresh salad. It pairs wonderfully with Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine from Emilia-Romagna.</p>
